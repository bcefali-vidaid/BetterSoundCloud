# Better SoundCloud

Better SoundCloud is an open source project to improve the usability of the SoundCloud browser interface. The project is primarily concerned with parsing, filtering, and collating SoundCloud items, whether they are tracks or playlists, and then presenting them in a way that is more intuitive for the user.

### Prerequisites

Google Chrome and access to the Chrome web store.

### Installing

Install the extension from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/better-soundcloud/nkeeogkohgghdbcjjjohielkpijpcpad).


### Usage Instructions

Simply right click the BSC icon to the right of the URL field and configure BSC settings through the "options" menu item.

By default, only promoted posts are filtered, but BSC can be easily configured to filter based on a custom set of criteria in that page.
